### Description

Following the study [Housing and child health in sub-Saharan Africa: A cross-sectional analysis](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003055) (Tusting et al., *PLoS Medicine*, 2020) (for which the data extraction code is in [Stage_04](../Stage_04_Building_Quality_Child_Health), work is now underway to extend the scope of this study. Several additional variables have been added to the child-level part of the extraction, and the extraction has been repeated to cover surveys across LAC and SEA as well as SSA. This folder will contain code used to generate those latest extractions.

### Usage history
