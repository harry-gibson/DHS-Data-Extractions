README updated 2021-02-18, HSG

### Description

This folder contains code and descriptions for a series of related DHS data extraction projects spanning several years. 

The various studies involved have sought to understand the changing prevalence over time of "improved housing", and to relate this (and various household-level indicators of wealth) to health outcomes in children (malaria infection, fever, vaccinations). 

Although there were several separate studies here, the DHS extractions involved were each largely a development of the one before, and so they are presented together here. 

### Usage history

Each sub-folder has a separate README in which the publication(s) associated with each project are listed.

### Implementation

Generally SQL queries, many with an accompanying FME workbench to assist in executing them.
