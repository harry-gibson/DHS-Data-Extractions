# DHS-Data-Extractions

This repository contains code used to perform various extractions and analyses of [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com) data that are stored in a relational database.

Further information on designing, creating, and populating the database, necessary before any of the code in this repository can be used, can be found [here](https://github.com/harry-gibson/DHS-To-Database). This repository shows ways in which the database has been used to extract information that is linked to various papers.

The repository is arranged into folders, one per data extraction project, each of which has a readme giving more information about the project and implementation.

The code in this repository was all written by Harry Gibson. The majority of the work was done at the [Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org) when it was based in Oxford, UK.
